## COMPONENTS:

### SENSOR-1:
•	Thermocouple sensor is used to check the temperature of the water.  
•	It is contact type sensor.  
•	Sends an alert if threshold is exceeded.  

### SENSOR-2:
•	LMK 382 sensor is used as water level sensor.   
•	It is submersible.    
•	Can withstand till 125degree celcius.   
•	Has a range of 3meters.   
•	Output signal:4-20mA.   

## ARM MICROCONTROLLER:

•	16 bit ARM7 micro controller.   
•	32kb RAM.   
•	512kb program flash.    
•	2x32 bit timers.      

## HEATING ELEMENT:

•	1000 W geyser is used as heating element.   
•	Material-Copper.    
•	Voltage-220V.    

## REQUIREMENTS
### HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
•	The ultimate purpose is to heat water to set temperature.     
•	When exceeds the set temperature, power should be automatically cut-off.  
•	The current temperature should be displayed in an LCD.  
•	Should alert the user when the temperature is reached.  

### LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:

•	Heating element is used for the ultimate purpose of heating.  
•	Water level sensor is used to detect the presence of water to the required level.   
•	Thermostat is used to check the change in temperature.  
•	LCD is used to display the temperature captured.  
•	A buzzer is used to alert the user when the temperature is reached.
