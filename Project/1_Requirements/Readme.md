### SWOT ANALYSIS
![](/Project/6_ImagesAndVideos/S.W.O.T.png) 

###  5W's & 1H

#### what - This a controller that helps to automaticlly refill the water tank using sensors and micro controller.

#### when - It is used when we need to fill water to the pressure tank.

#### Where - It can be used in domestic,Industrial as well as Commercial complexes.

#### who - Normal consumers are the people who use this.

#### why - Inorder to refill water to the tank without wastage.

### 1H:

#### How - By using a micro-controller, sensors and few actuators.

###   Components Description
### Microcontroller
   Microcontroller is used to control the overall process in automating the refill of water into the tank.

## SENSORS
### Water level sensor
 Two water level sensors are used to detect the water level. One for detecting if the tank is empty and another one detecting the top level of the tank.

### Water Quality sensor
 A water quality sensor is used to check the sediments and excess chlorine in the water and alert the user.

## ACTUATORS
### Motor Driver Circuit
   Motor Driver circuit is used to switch on and off the based upon the signals received from the sensors.

### Buzzer
  A buzzer is used to alert the user once the tank is filled.

### LED’s
 Two LED’s are used to alert the user regarding the quality of the water.  
           *  RED – The water is impure.  
           *  GREEN – The water is pure.  

### Power Supply
   AC power supply is converted to DC and  given to the circuit in order to run it.
