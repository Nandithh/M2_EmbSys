##   WATER TANK CONTROLLER WITH QUALITY CHECK

### INTRODUCION
 Water tank controller with Quality check is a system that shall be used to refill water tanks in houses and commercial buildings. This helps in elimination of manual monitoring and refilling of water tanks. The major advantages of the system is that it helps in automating tasks and also there is no wastage of water overflowing from tanks. It also provides the facility to check water quality as well. The components used in the system is very simple which makes the product economically accessible as well. The overall system development phase is explained.
        


## REQUIREMENTS

### High Level Requirements:

ID     | Description
-------| -----------------------------------------
HLR 1  |To Refill the water tank automatically when tank becomes empty.
HLR 2  |Alert the user when the tank is filled.
HLR 3  |To check the quality of water and alert user.
HLR 4  |To turn ON the motor when the tank becomes empty.

### Low Level Requirements:


ID     | Description
-------| -----------------------------------------
LLR 1  |A Microcontroller is used for controlling the process.
LLR 1.1  |A water level sensor is used to check the water level.
LLR 2  |Buzzer is used to alert the user.
LLR 3  |A water Quality sensor is used to chechk the quality of the water
LLR 4  |A Motor Driver shall be used to switch ON the motor.

## Components Description

### Microcontroller
   Microcontroller is used to control the overall process in automating the refill of water ito the tank.

### Thermistor
 Two water level sensors are used to detect the water level. One for detecting if the tank is empty and another one detecting the top level of the tank.

### Ultrasonic sensor
   Relay circuit is used to switch on and off the relay based on the signals received from microcontroller.

### Keypad

AC Power supply is given to the circuit inorder to run it.
  
### Relay
  Rectifier is used to convert 230 V AC power supply into 5 V DC power supply. Since, microcontroller and DS 1307 are digital electronic devices they operate only in DC power supply.

### LCD Display
  A buzzer is used to alert the user once the tank is filled.
