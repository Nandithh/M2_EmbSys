##   Components Description
### Microcontroller
   Microcontroller is used to control the overall process in automating the refill of water into the tank.

## SENSORS
### Water level sensor
 Two water level sensors are used to detect the water level. One for detecting if the tank is empty and another one detecting the top level of the tank.

### Water Quality sensor
 A water quality sensor is used to check the sediments and excess chlorine in the water and alert the user.

## ACTUATORS
### Motor Driver Circuit
   Motor Driver circuit is used to switch on and off the based upon the signals received from the sensors.

### Buzzer
  A buzzer is used to alert the user once the water is poor in quality.

### LED’s
 Two LED’s are used to alert the user regarding the water level.  
            * RED – The tank is Empty.
            * GREEN – The tank is full.  

### Power Supply
   AC power supply is converted to DC and  given to the circuit in order to run it.
